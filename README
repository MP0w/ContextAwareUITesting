# Context Aware UI Testing

A prototype for a random idea to write E2E tests in a declarative way.
This allows the UI test to recover from issues (e.g. network errors), less needs for waits, etc... You would get retrying for free and resilience.

Uses the screen abstraction pattern but creates a list of "steps" instead of using the driver directly.
Then it goes one by one, in case something fails will ask the app for the current screen id and restart from the first step on that screen.
(currently XCUITest doesn't let you query the current screen id, I did an hack for that but there are some ways to eventually implement it).
